This past weekend I had the privilege of speaking at the Ohio DevFest in Columbus, Ohio. This was an important conference for me because I got to represent my home state of Ohio! The conference was really well organized and was at an awesome venue (the Ohio State University Student Union). I was able to meet several other Googlers as well as finally meet the Ohio Google Developer Group Organizers (as I live several hours away from all of them :sadface). I was able to connect after my talk with several students who are currently in computer science programs as well as current engineers who were looking for some advice. Overall, I was honored to speak and hope to potentially make it happen again in 2024! Above is an interview I did after my talk for some more context.
