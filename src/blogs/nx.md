Over the years, my career in software engineering has been driven by a passion for building high-quality applications, improving developer workflows, and sharing knowledge with the community. Today, Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that Iâ€™ve stepped into a new role as a Developer Productivity Engineer at Nx!


## Why Nx?
Nx has been a game-changer in the world of modern development, helping teams scale monorepos efficiently and optimize their developer experience. As someone who has always been passionate about performance, automation, and streamlining software development, joining Nx felt like a natural step. The opportunity to work alongside some of the best in the industry, contribute to innovative tooling, and help developers build faster, more maintainable applications is something I couldnâ€™t pass up.

## What This Means For Me
As I transition into this role, my focus will be on:
âœ… Improving developer productivity
âœ… Improving build performance at scale
âœ… Advocating for best practices in monorepo development
âœ… Contributing to open-source projects and sharing insights with the community
âœ… Building robust partners in the Nx ecosystem

Iâ€™ve always believed that better developer experiences lead to better softwareâ€”and Iâ€™m excited to help make that a reality at Nx.


## What's Next?
While my day-to-day will shift toward improving developer productivity at scale, my commitment to mentorship, open-source contributions, and community engagement remains stronger than ever. Iâ€™ll continue sharing insights through blog posts, conference talks, and open-source contributions, helping developers get the most out of their tooling and workflows.

If youâ€™re as passionate about performance, automation, and developer experience as I am, letâ€™s connect! Whether youâ€™re looking to optimize your development process or just geek out about productivity, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
