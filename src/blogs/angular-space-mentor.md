## About Becoming A Mentor

I am super excited to announce that I have joined the Angular Space Mentorship program. As an mentor I will help mentor those who are looking to start or improve their technical writing skills. This is something I am deeply passionate about as I am always looking for ways I can give back to the community and this is an outstanding avenue for me to do so.
