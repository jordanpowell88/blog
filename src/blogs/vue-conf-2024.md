title: 'I Spoke at Vue Conf USA 2024'

I just got home after an amazing trip to New Orleans for [Vue Conf 2024](https://vueconf.us/). It was both my first time in New Orleans and speaking at Vue Conf. Both were incredible experiences that I am extremely grateful for. Below are some of my top of mind thoughts after taking some time to reflect on the experience:

# ABOUT MY TALK

I delivered a talk that I have given at several conferences over the past year titled "AI and the Future of Testing". It is probably one of my most favorite and challenging talks to deliver. I approached the subject of AI and Testing from a philosophical perspective. I shared our philosophy around testing here at Cypress and discussed the ramifications that it has when considering Generative AI in the testing space. I was able to demonstrate 3 examples of using generative AI around both test generation and test conversion. One of the challenges of this talk is that every time I deliver it live I get a different set of responses! Which, [spoiler alert] validates my hypothesis. For what it's worth, I am really excited to see how accurate I am or am not whenever "the future" arrives! All in all, I thought the talk was super fun and the attendees were super engaged!

## THE VUE COMMUNITY IS FANTASTIC!

I really mean this! Most of my technical talks to this point in my career have been pretty centered around both [Angular](https://angular.dev/) and/or [Cypress](https://cypress.io) testing. Both communities that will forever hold a special place in my heart. With that being said I've never had the opportunity to meet some of the more prominent voices in the Vue community. This conference was my first exposure to many of these people and I must say I was very impressed by how welcoming and nice everyone was (not that I was concerned). From the conference speakers to the attendees, so many of you came up and said hi to me and were super friendly!

## THE VUE ECOSYSTEM IS IN A GREAT PLACE!

Vue is admittedly the framework in which I've logged the least amount of hours. With that being said, every time I've used it I've been impressed and it just seems to make sense. It takes many of the things that I love from both the Angular and React ecosystems and combines them into a singular experience that most developers love! I am also super impressed with both its maturity and stability for a framework that is not backed by a large company like Google or Meta and is probably the "most open-source" of all the frameworks.

## ACCESSIBILITY!

One of the most positive things that stood out to myself was how many of the talks discussed [Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/). As one of the engineers on the [Accessibility](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2024/02/16/introducing-cypress-accessibility) Team here at Cypress, I was very encouraged by the concerted effort to make Accessibility important! Good Job Vue Community!

## NUXT!

We continue to see a huge push across the industry around the concept of server components and meta-frameworks. This is no exception within the Vue Community where many of the talks highlighted the strength of [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/)! Let me just say, it's FAST! Like REALLY FAST!

## EDUCATION!

One of the strengths in my opinion of Vue is the way it has become for many the go framework for learning front-end development. I think this can be attributed to its great Developer Experience! It's arguably the "easiest" framework to get started with (yet scales extremely well). I also believe this has become a space that has been prioritized across the Vue Community. There were several excellent education resources at Vue Conf including [Vue School](https://vueschool.io/) and [Vue Mastery](http://vuemastery.com/).

## FOOD!

I know many of you came for the technical talk but let me tell you I couldn't end this article without talking about New Orleans and the amazing people, food and art! You all have got this figured out!
